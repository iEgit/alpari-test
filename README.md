alpari-test
===========

This tiny app was developed for Alpari. The only thing it does is dragging items from one list to another. There's only one special thing about it: dragging to the first list should copy the dragged item to the first one.  

### To see it in action please visit [heroku app](http://alpari-test.herokuapp.com/)

Feel free to use this stuff.
